# Check Out The W

This is Gatsby site that leverages Netlify CMS for content editing. It is a great starting point to deploy a small personal site, or a foundation to scale for a project even larger.

## To get started with this project:

Clone the project to your local development environment:

```
git clone git@github.com:hkolsen/check-out-the-w.git
```

Run Yarn in the console to install all dependencies:

```
yarn
```

Once complete, run the following to preview locally:

```
yarn start
```

To build the project and serve on your local server:

```
yarn build && yarn serve
```

## Roadmap:

- Light and Dark Mode
- Create consistent components as part of a larger design system
- Enhance UX with animations and `prefers-reduced-motion` query
- Move from single-page to multiple-pages
- Screenshot testing
